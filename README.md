# HostelUtilities

HostelUtilities is a website which provides all hostel services. The purpose of this website is to automate and facilitate the whole process of various services carried out in the hostel.

The main idea is to facilitate the functioning of day-to-day activities in the hostel and make a more structured database.

Most of the common services which are to be provided by the  hostel without any fail are often overlooked by the caretaker and not resolved in time.

To solve this issue we decided to make a website which keeps track of all the activities carried out in the hostel and giving the residents a platform to make sure their problems are resolved as soon as possible
